# NOVXIS

**Network Observation, Visualization, eXploration Interface System**

NOVXIS is an open-source networking education, exploration, visualization, and troubleshooting project focused on making abstract network behavior visually concrete.

Phase 0 is intentionally console-first. The first vertical slice uses ARP to prove that NOVXIS can capture or replay real traffic, decode protocol evidence, produce normalized events, and present those events clearly.

## Phase 0 Development Environment

The initial development baseline is Python 3.14.

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3.14 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install NOVXIS and the development dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

## Interface Enumeration Spike

The first capture-layer spike simply asks Scapy which interfaces are available to NOVXIS:

```bash
python -m novxis.cli.interfaces
```

After installation, the equivalent console command is:

```bash
novxis-interfaces
```

This step does not yet capture traffic. It verifies that the development environment can load Scapy and discover network interfaces before the live-capture prototype is introduced.

## Current Phase 0 Boundary

The first supported protocol vertical slice is ARP.
